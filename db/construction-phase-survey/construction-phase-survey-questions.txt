In comparison to the elaboration phase, the dynamics have evolved positively.
In my view, I've felt that the group coding sessions were an effective way of building software.
As a member of this group, I believe that the Christmas Holidays have been scheduled/adjusted rightly.
As a member of this group, as the end of the Construction phase approaches, I am concerned about the project's completion and the accomplishment of all essential deliverables.
During the Construction phase, I felt that my contributions/opinions were validated in this team.
I've personally struggled with the knowledge required in the Construction phase.
I found the techniques and software (GitLab, JavaFX, IntelliJ Idea, etc.) applied (during the phase) obsolete and ineffective.
I believe that team members' contributions (as well as overall workload) are more equally spread than during the project's elaboration phase.
