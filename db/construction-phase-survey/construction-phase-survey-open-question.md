### What should be preserved (for the upcoming phases)?

- Things are going well I believe, well planned.
- Workload division, communication 
- Overall it feels like the group members has been able to work better, with better structure and communication
- The team's willingness to take individual responsibility and create motivation even when there sometimes isn't any initially.
- Trello and the task distribution within the platform.

### What could be improved?

- Meetings should be scheduled beforehand
- Just keep it up until the project ends
- Not that much to be honest. The team has found a structure that works well

### Any additional concerns or difficulties (or anything else related)?

- No concerns
