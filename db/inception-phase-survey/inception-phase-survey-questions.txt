I've enjoyed the dynamics of the team during the initial phase.
In this team, I feel that my contributions are validated.
I've personally struggled with the knowledge required in the initial phase.
I found the techniques applied (during the phase) obsolete and ineffective.
I feel that all team members have contributed equally to the creation of the project.
