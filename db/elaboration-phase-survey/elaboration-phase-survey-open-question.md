### What should be preserved (for the upcoming phases)?

- Planning work as well as the budget, good communication between team members, and regular pre-scheduled meetings.
- "Our way of conducting effective meetings, such as our UX prototype meeting where we got a lot done because everyone was engaged and wanted to actively contribute.
- We should also preserve the team's frequent communication through all used media such as discord etc."
- Weekly planning and task sharing can be done by discussing the tasks in the meetings held on Mondays
- The use of Trello and Discord.

### What could be improved?

- Not letting one person too everything regarding to specific subject, instead divide it for at least two people.
- The team could probably benefit from spending more time than before in meetings face to face on campus for the next phase, since it involves a lot of difficult javaFX coding which the majority of the team is still not used to writing.
- Empathize people's lack of knowledge, a task can be very easy for someone, thus person may have a great experience, but not everyone has such experience. This course is part of a learning process, there are no prerequisites for registration in this program, such as prior knowledge in PM or being a graduate of a similar university program. 
- The workload is still not optional, some team members, as it seems, refuse to do the bare minimum, whilst some others completely carry the work for the whole team - this is, indeed, very unfair.

### List concepts/aspects that we should pay more attention to.

- Delegating workload between members, either individually or in teams of 2 or 3; Active participation during meetings; Keeping focus and planning on being more or less done with the whole project before december 17th
- 1-Team spirit; 2-Respect for the backgrounds of the other group members (This should not be evaluated as one-sided, this respect has to be two-sided. The person who lacks knowledge should have respect the experience of other people and show that they put the necessary effort for the goal. Same for the people who has experience.
- JavaFX (and additional frameworks); coding sessions.
